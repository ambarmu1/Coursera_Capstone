The components will then be compared between the two cities to understand their similarity and identify characteristics using a descriptive approach. Where data may not be complete for the entire area of the cities, a sample may be used (for example: using the number of crimes per 100,000 people in the Manhattan borough of New York to predict to forecast the overall crime rate of New York City). The types of existing venues and their traffic will be used to determine the likelihood for a new business owner to open up an establishment in their geographic area.",
